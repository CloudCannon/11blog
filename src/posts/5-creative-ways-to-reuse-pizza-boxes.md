create compartments for utensils, office supplies, or jewelry, helping you keep everything neatly sorted.

With a little modification, pizza boxes can be turned into seed starting trays. Cut holes in the bottom for
drainage, fill with potting soil, and plant your seeds. Once the seedlings are ready, transplant them into your
garden or larger pots.

you have.
